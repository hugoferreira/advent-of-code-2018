Solutions to [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com) programming contest, using Functional(ish) Javascript.

## Why Functional

Because I like it. Because I think very easily in terms of combinators. Because, why not?

## Why Javascript

Because I hate it. I mean, EcmaScript is becoming decent. Typescript is becoming very decent. But there are terrible inconsistencies in the Javascript common libraries. 

## Why both?

Once you start writing JS in a functional way, it's almost bearable. It's also a very good way to force you to learn it.

## Your solutions are not (always) pure

Yeah, well... JS kind of makes it a huge hassle sometimes, and I have limited time to do this.

## Why not other languages?

Like Haskell and Scala? Been there, done that.
